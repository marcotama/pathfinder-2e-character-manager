If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.<br><br> The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion''s attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion''s Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn''t correspond to the image of the monster - for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage - the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.<br><br> Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn''t take any further damage from it.<br><b>Heightened (+1)</b> The damage of the image''s Strikes increases by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).','Form a convincing illusion of a creature.',NULL,'https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=158'),
