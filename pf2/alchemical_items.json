Breaking the rock open with a Break Open action (DC 25) reveals a cavity at the stone's heart.\nThe cavity is lined with a rare type of quicksilver that can transmute base metals into precious metals or create an elixir of rejuvenation.,\nTo use the stone's quicksilver, you must be Legendary in Crafting and you must have the Alchemical Crafting feat. You can then apply the stone's quicksilver for one of two effects:\n* You can apply the stone's quicksilver to an infused true elixir of life using an Operate Activation action to create an infused elixir of rejuvenation. This is instantaneous and does not require any crafting time or additional materials.\n* You can spend up to a month of downtime applying the quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead to create gold.
